            <p>The meeting started with Dad drilling a hole in the bot as the students walked in. I attempted to tell Carlie in a nice and respectful way that Mr. Williams (Code Mentor) had asked me to teach her and Anton how to commit and push, and pull code from <a href="https://github.com">Github.</a> Its a pretty simple process that really only consists of downloading some helpful software from <a href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/">SmartGit</a> and configuring it to recognize some code changes. I'm sure it would have only taken 15 min or so (of our three hours).</p>

            <p>Unfortunatley when Carlie asked why I hadn't told Anton I was supposed to teach them, I replied by saying he was busy with the electrical board and I wasn't going to bother him (I respect Anton a lot). She took that as an opportunity to claim that she was also working with him yesterday and today. Im sitting here watching her while writing this and she isn't really doing much but walking around. Whatever. I told Matt that we would just have to wait until he was back to get the job done. He didn't seem worried but the meeting beginning with a talk about time management makes me feel otherwise.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Outside of Robotics</h2>

            <p>In other news, my day sadly started with <a href= "https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=161557">a post that I read on ChiefDelphi.com</a> The thread is about the captain of FRC Team 987 the Highrollers. He sadly took his own life yesterday and the community is pretty shaken up about it. It's so sad that people feel the need to take their own life and I think the community and hopefully the rest of the world agrees with me on that.</p>

            <p>I think I'm going to include random images for the headers of these blog posts. It might keep it fresh a bit. Don't be worried about me writing about people on the team. I'll keep it respectful and just tell the truth from my perspective. They probably won't be the people reading this blog anyways.</p>

            <p>One last thing. Altough this didn't happen today necesarrily it was recently. I crashed Mom and Dad's car. I honestly don't know why I was only the road I was on, but it was slippery. I slid and hit the curb and while that doens't sound like a lot, it was like $3500 in damages based on the insurance claim. Mom has decided to make me pay $100. I don't have a whole lot of money at the moment but my friend Arad has considered paying me to make him a website for his app. Thats all I think.</p>

            <p>Over and out Captain</p>
